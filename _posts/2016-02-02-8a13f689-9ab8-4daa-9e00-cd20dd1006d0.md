### "In science, convictions have no rights of citizenship, as is said 
with good reason. Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of a 
hypothesis, of a provisional experimental point of view, of a regulative
fiction, maybe they be granted admission and even a certain value 
within the realm of knowledge ---though always with the restriction that 
they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. But 
does this not mean, more precisely considered, that a conviction may 
obtain admission to science only when it _ceases _to be a conviction?" --- Friedrich Nietzsche
