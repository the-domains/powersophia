            <title><![CDATA[“In science, convictions have no rights of citizenship, as is said 
with good reason. Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of a 
hypothesis, of a provisional experimental point of view, of a regulative
 fiction, maybe they be granted admission and even a certain value 
within the realm of knowledge—though always with the restriction that 
they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. But 
does this not mean, more precisely considered, that a conviction may 
obtain admission to science only when it ceases to be a conviction?” ]]></title>
